# Memory game



A card game written with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
<br></br>
There is an even number of cards lying face down. The player turns over any two cards by clicking on them. If the colours match it's good, and the cards stay face up. If they don't match, the cards turn back over, and the player should try and remember their colour. The aim is to find all the matching pairs with as fewer clicks as possible. The user chooses how many cards to play with. There is a clicks counter.
